This default example creates the 2D attenuation example of Komatitsch and Tromp (1999, Figure 16).

TO RUN:

0. Read the user manual in SPECFEM2D/doc/manual_SPECFEM2D.pdf

1. in the SPECFEM2D root directory, configure, e.g.,
   ./configure FC=gfortran

2. compile:
   make all

3. cd EXAMPLES/attenuation/

4. execute script to run mesher and solver for the PSV case:
   ./process.sh

5. check out the output files in the local directory OUTPUT_FILES; in particular, you can type "gnuplot plot_compare_to_analytical_solution.gnu" to compare the seismograms computed to the quasi-analytical solution of Carcione et al. (1988). Note that because our example has no absorbing conditions on the edges of the grid, there are extra (spurious) waves after the main P and S waves, reflected off the edges of the grid, which are not present in the quasi-analytical solution and which you can safely ignore. Beware that the reference solution is not exact, only quasi-exact (i.e., the formulation uses an approximation, and some integrals are computed numerically) therefore some small discrepancies can be noticed.
