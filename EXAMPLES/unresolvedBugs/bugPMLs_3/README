This is a simple bug to correct I guess.
With this setting (which is correct) we obtain:
error: PML thickness set is wrong

If we remove the PMLs everything works well. It works if we set :
absorbbottom                    = .true.
absorbright                     = .true.
absorbtop                       = .false.
absorbleft                      = .false.

instead of:
absorbbottom                    = .false.
absorbright                     = .true.
absorbtop                       = .false.
absorbleft                      = .false.
