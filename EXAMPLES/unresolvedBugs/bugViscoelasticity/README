This bug occurs in simulations with many time steps and viscoelastic media (without PMLs).
It seems to happen quicker if the model includes fluid-solid coupling.
The code slowly explodes at some spots in the viscoelastic part. It exists since at least 01/28/2017.
_The mesh has no influence (we use the internal mesher)
_SOLVOPT neither
_NSLS neither
_Read_velocity_at_f0 neither
