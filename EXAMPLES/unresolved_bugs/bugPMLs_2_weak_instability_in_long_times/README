This bug occurs in simulations with many time steps and viscoelastic media with PMLs. Even if the PMLs are not in contact with
the viscoelastic part!!

Clue (??) : run_this_example_otherBug.sh -> the explosion is immediate when replacing the elastic cushion by a fluid!

Appart from the explosion in the PMLs one can see:
_An important amount of energy reflected at the PMLs at the beginning of the run
_The spots already discussed in bugPMLs_1
